## About me

Currently, I'm studying computer science at the University of Southampton, UK. I have a particular interest in mathematics and ML.

Previously I consulted with clients through  [Zealous Digital](https://www.zealous.digital).  I refined a story-driven marketing and strategy framework, built websites for clients and helped them figure out how to build better products which reached more people. I still do some work with existing clients, however, I no longer take on new projects (but do advise from time-to-time for particularly exciting areas).

## About the blog

My focus is on learning how to be a better problem solver and developer. I'll write about interesting problems and projects on that journey here. I'll also share some of my thoughts on the startup world.
